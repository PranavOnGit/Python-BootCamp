# pip is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages. 
# It connects to an online repository of public packages, called the Python Package Index

# Consider a Module to be the same as a code library.
# A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

# Pre-defined or Inbuilt Modules: the modules which are presnet already in /Lib
# Some modules which are not present in python doc can be installed using pip 
# [ https://docs.python.org/3.11/installing/index.html ]
